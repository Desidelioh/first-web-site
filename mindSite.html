            <p>Mental wellbeing doesn't have one set meaning. We might use it to talk about <span
                    style="background-color: aquamarine;"> how we feel, how well we're
                    coping with daily life </span> or what feels possible at the moment. Good mental wellbeing doesn't
                mean you're always happy or unaffected by your experiences. But poor
                mental wellbeing can make it more difficult to cope with daily life.</p>

            <h2>Tips for improving your mental wellbeing</h2>
            There are lots of things we can try to take care of our wellbeing. We have tips to help you:

            <div id="tips">
                <ol>
                    <li>Relax and reduce stress</li>
                    <li>Find ways to learn and be creative</li>
                    <li>Spend time in nature</li>
                    <li>Connect with others</li>
                    <li>Look after your physical health</li>
                    <li>Try to get enough sleep</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p> It's not always easy to start with caring for your wellbeing. You might find it helpful to
                give yourself time to figure out what works for you, going at your own pace
                take small steps. Pick one or two things that feel achievable at first, before moving on to try other
                ideas.
                If you're finding things difficult and these tips don't feel possible, it's ok to ask for help.
            </p>

            <p> Or if
                you've been diagnosed with a mental health problem you might be looking for information on your
                diagnosis, treatment options and where to go for support. Our information pages will help you learn
                more.

            <h2>Relax and reduce stress</h2>
            <p>If there's something that helps you relax, try to find time to fit it into your day. For
                example, this
                could be having a bath or going for a walk. If you find it difficult to switch off, you could try some
                of the following tips:</p>

            <h3>Take a break if you need to</h3>
            <p>If you're feeling overwhelmed by a stressful situation, try to take a break. A change of
                scene can help
                you to relax and relieve feelings of anxiety, even just for a few minutes.</p>


            <h3>Do something you enjoy</h3>
            <p> Try to make time to do an activity you like on a regular basis. This could be something
                small, like
                cooking a meal, ringing a friend or listening to music.</p>


            <h3>Try to manage stress</h3>
            <p>If you're under a lot of pressure, you may start to feel overwhelmed or out of control.
                Stress can also
                cause physical side effects.</p>
